After this, he started asking me questions related to Projects, which even I was hearing for the first time, however, I did answer, as the tech stack was somewhat similar to my project. But when he specified the tech stack for next project, I was sure this wasn't my project, I polietly requested him to recheck the resume, after which we came to know that he accidently mismatched the resume, I took a sigh of relief.
